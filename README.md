# 🧬 Prism Protein Structure AI

> **AI-powered pipeline for protein structure processing, DSSP conversion, and 3D structure visualization.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project automates the **conversion of PDB protein structures into DSSP files**, forming a foundation for **3D visualization, structure-based learning**, and **disease-linked anomaly detection**.

It represents the first stage of a broader research vision — to use **machine learning** for predicting structural anomalies and their biological impact.

## 🧩 Features

- 🧠 Batch DSSP processing with progress tracking  
- ⚙️ Auto-skip for already processed files  
- 📊 Log management for warnings and errors  
- 🔁 Resume support for interrupted runs  
- 🧬 Ready for future ML & visualization integration

# 💡 Suggestions to Make Your Repo Stand Out

✅ **GitHub Description:**  
AI-powered pipeline for protein structure processing, DSSP conversion, and 3D visualization — building towards anomaly detection & disease prediction.

✅ **GitHub Topics/Tags:**  
`protein-structure` `bioinformatics` `machine-learning` `computational-biology` `pdb` `dssp` `3d-visualization` `biopython` `structural-biology`


✅ **Repo Tips:**  
- Add a demo GIF in the README once you visualize structures.  
- Include a short **project video link** once ready.  
- Pin this repo to your GitHub profile for visibility.  
- Add a **CITATION.cff** file later for research credibility.
